                    <h3>Why Split PDF by File Size?</h3>
                    <p>There are several important reasons why you might need to split PDF files by file size:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Email Attachment Limits</strong>: Most email providers have size limits for attachments (typically between 10-25MB)</li>
                        <li><strong>Upload Restrictions</strong>: Many websites and cloud services impose file size limits for uploads</li>
                        <li><strong>Faster Downloads</strong>: Smaller files download more quickly, especially on slower internet connections</li>
                        <li><strong>Easier File Management</strong>: Large PDFs can be unwieldy to handle and store</li>
                        <li><strong>Better Compatibility</strong>: Some devices and software struggle with very large PDF files</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Common File Size Limits You Might Encounter</h3>
                    <p>Understanding typical file size restrictions can help you determine the best way to split your PDFs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Email Providers</strong>: Gmail (25MB), Outlook (20MB), Yahoo Mail (25MB)</li>
                        <li><strong>Cloud Storage</strong>: Google Drive (no individual file size limit for most plans), Dropbox (50GB for basic uploads)</li>
                        <li><strong>File Sharing Services</strong>: WeTransfer (2GB for free), SendSpace (300MB for free)</li>
                        <li><strong>Website Uploads</strong>: Varies by platform but often between 5-50MB</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Advanced Tips for Splitting PDF by File Size</h3>
                    <p>To get the most out of PDFSplit's file size splitting feature, consider these expert tips:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leave Some Buffer Room</strong>: If you need files under 10MB for email, try setting the limit to 9MB to account for any slight variations</li>
                        <li><strong>Consider Content Distribution</strong>: If your PDF has pages with varying content density (like text-heavy vs. image-heavy pages), the split points might not be perfectly even</li>
                        <li><strong>Combine with Compression</strong>: For extremely large files, consider compressing your PDF before splitting for even better results</li>
                        <li><strong>Use Descriptive File Names</strong>: After splitting, rename your files to reflect their content and order for easier organization</li>
                    </ul>
